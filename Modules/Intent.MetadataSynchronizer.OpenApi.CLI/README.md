# Intent OpenApi Metadata Synchronizer

> **⚠️ ARCHIVED**: This CLI tool has been superseded by the in-process OpenAPI importer in `Intent.Modules.OpenApi.Importer`.
>
> **The CLI project is preserved for reference only and is no longer actively maintained.**
>
> For new projects, use the OpenAPI import feature directly in Intent Architect through the Services Designer's context menu.

## Archive Notice

As of version 1.1.9+, all OpenAPI import functionality has been migrated to the `Intent.Modules.OpenApi.Importer` module, which executes the import logic in-process without spawning an external CLI tool. This provides:

- ⚡ Better performance (no process spawning overhead)
- 🛡️ Improved reliability (direct method invocation)
- 🐛 Enhanced debuggability (step through entire flow)
- 🔧 Easier maintenance (single codebase)

**Migration Path**: Simply use the latest version of the `Intent.Modules.OpenApi.Importer` module. The CLI is no longer required.

## Original Documentation (Historical Reference)

The Intent OpenApi Metadata Synchronizer CLI tool can be used to synchronize an OpenApi (3.*) file into an Intent Architect Services package.

This tool can be useful for creating Intent Architect Service Packages based on Open API / Swagger definitions.

## Pre-requisites

Latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Installation

The tool is available as a [.NET Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) and can be installed with the following command:

```powershell
dotnet tool install Intent.MetadataSynchronizer.OpenApi.CLI --global --prerelease
```

> [!NOTE]
> If `dotnet tool install` fails with an error to the effect of `The required NuGet feed can't be accessed, perhaps because of an Internet connection problem.` and it shows a private NuGet feed URL, you can try add the `--ignore-failed-sources` command line option ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/troubleshoot-usage-issues#nuget-feed-cant-be-accessed)).

You should see output to the effect of:

```text
You can invoke the tool using the following command: intent-openapi-metadata-synchronizer
Tool 'intent.metadatasynchronizer.openapi.cli' (version 'x.x.x') was successfully installed.
```

## Usage

`intent-openapi-metadata-synchronizer [options]`

### Options

|Option                                   |Description|
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
|`--config-file <config-file>`            |Path to a [JSON formatted file](#configuration-file) containing options to use for execution of this tool as an alternative to using command line options. The `--generate-config-file` option can be used to generate a file with all the possible fields populated with null.|
|`--generate-config-file`                 |Scaffolds into the current working directory a "config.json" for use with the `--config-file` option.|
|`--open-api-specification-file <source-open-api-file>`  |The name of the OpenApi (3.*) file to parse and synchronize into the Intent Architect Package. This can be a Json or Xaml file.|
|`--isln-file <isln-file>`                |The Intent Architect solution (.isln) file containing the Intent Architect Application into which to synchronize the metadata.|
|`--application-name <application-name>`  |The name of the Intent Architect Application (as per the Application Settings view) containing the Intent Architect Package into which to synchronize the metadata.|
|`--package-id <package-id>`              |The id of the Intent Architect Package containing the Intent Architect Package into which to synchronize the metadata.|
|`--target-folder-id <target-folder-id>`  |The target folder within the Intent Architect package into which to synchronize the metadata. If unspecified then the metadata will be synchronized into the root of the Intent Architect package.|
|`--service-type <service-type>`          |What paradigm of Service Model woudl you like. Options are CQRS or Service.|

### Configuration file

The `--config-file` option expects the name of a file containing configuration options to be used as an alternative to adding them as CLI options. A template for the configuration file can be generated using the `--generate-config-file` option. The content of the generated template is as follows:

```json
{
    "OpenApiSpecificationFile": null,
    "IslnFile": null,
    "ApplicationName":  null,
    "PackageId":  null,
    "TargetFolderId":  null,
    "ServiceType": "CQRS",
    "IsAzureFunctions": false,
    "AllowRemoval": true
}
```
